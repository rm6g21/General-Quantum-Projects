This is an active project aimed to demonstrate why circular infinite potential wells have some closed nodal line eigenvectors (lines in the eigenstate where the probability of finding the particle is 0). The code is (hopefully) working, however the mathematical investigation as to why only one has them is still an issue. It is likely that the square is orthogonal whilst all other shapes between the circle and square are not orthogonal (in terms of their shape), but this is only predicted and has little mathematical evidence but instead is based on the empirical data.
