# General-Quantum-Projects
Anything quantum related that isn't in other modules. Can be in Pennylane, QuTip, Qiskit and more. This is not the extent of my quantum work (check other repositories) but is more of a "misc" repository. For more in-depth quantum computation, check the Pennylane-Codebook module.
